Just a bunch of personal scripts to help me move like a ninja.
Usually it's stuff that I am sick of typing out, checking and copying etc.

Probably there is a better way than writing `.sh` scripts, ideally I need something universal (applicable to unix and windows) that can be run from the command line.
